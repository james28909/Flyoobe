🆕 Setup Extensions: Host + Options Support
-------------------------------------------
The Setup Extensions system now supports extended script metadata in the header.  
This allows script authors to define dropdown menus and control how the script is executed.

✅ New Metadata Parameters:

  # Description: <string>
     • Short, user-friendly description of what the script does.
     • Displayed in the Extensions page below the title.

  # Host: embedded | console
     • embedded = run inside OOBE, output is captured and shown in the app.
     • console  = run in an external PowerShell window with -NoExit.
     • Default: embedded (if not specified).

  # Options: value1; value2; value3; ...
     • Defines multiple selectable actions for a single script.
     • A dropdown is automatically shown in the Extensions page.
     • The selected value is passed to the script as $choice.

Example Script Header:

  # Description: File Explorer tweaks
  # Host: embedded
  # Options: Show file extensions; Hide file extensions; Open This PC

  param([string]$choice)
  switch ($choice) {
      "Show file extensions" { ... }
      "Hide file extensions" { ... }
      "Open This PC" { ... }
  }

-------------------------------------------
With this update, one script can now provide multiple user actions,
and devs can control whether output stays inside the OOBE app 
or opens in a real console window.
